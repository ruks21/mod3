MERN Application

This project is a step-by-step guide for building a full-stack MERN application using MongoDB, Express,React and  Node.js. It is divided into multiple steps to guide you through the development process.

Step 01: Create Node.js project from scratch
In this step, you'll start by setting up a new Node.js project from scratch, which will serve as the backend for your application.

Step 02: Create our first Http Route
You'll learn how to create your first HTTP route using Node.js and Express.js. This route will be an initial step in building your API.

Step 03: Add MongoDB and mongoose to node js
This step focuses on integrating MongoDB, a NoSQL database, into your Node.js application using the Mongoose library.

Step 04: Create Book model with mongoose
You'll define a Mongoose schema for your "Book" model, which represents the data structure of books in your database.

Step 05: Save a new Book with mongoose
Here, you'll learn how to use Mongoose to create and save new book entries to your MongoDB database.

Step 06: Get All Books with mongoose
This step covers retrieving and displaying a list of all books from the MongoDB database.

Step 07: Get One Book by id with mongoose
You'll learn how to retrieve a single book by its unique identifier (ID) using Mongoose.

Step 08: Update a Book with mongoose
This step will teach you how to update book information in the database using Mongoose.

Step 09: Delete a book with mongoose
You'll explore how to delete a book record from the database using Mongoose.

Step 10: Refactor Node.js with express router
In this step, you'll refactor your Node.js application code to use Express.js routers, which helps organize and modularize your routes.

Step 11: CORS policy in Node.js and Express.js
You'll learn about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and how to implement CORS policies in your Node.js and Express.js application.

Step 12: Create React project, Vite, Tailwind CSS
This step focuses on setting up the front-end of your application by creating a React project using Vite and adding styling with Tailwind CSS.

Step 13: SPA and Add react router dom
You'll transform your React app into a Single Page Application (SPA) and add routing using React Router DOM.

Step 14: Show Books List in React
Learn how to display a list of books in your React application.

Step 15: Show Book Details in React
Implement a feature that allows users to view detailed information about a selected book.

Step 16: Create Book in React
This step covers creating new book entries from within the React application.

Step 17: Edit Book in React
Learn how to edit and update book details using the React app.

Step 18: Delete Book in React
Implement the functionality to delete a book directly from the React app.

Step 19: Show Books List as Card
Enhance the user interface by displaying the list of books in a card format.

Step 20: Make Book Card a single component
Refactor your React code to create a reusable Book Card component.

Step 21: Add Book Modal
Implement a modal for adding and editing books to improve the user experience.

Step 22: Improve User Experience (UX) with beautiful alert
Enhance the user experience with beautiful alerts or notifications.
